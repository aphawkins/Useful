### Project Useful

* Research of new, useful ideas that can be applied to everyday work.
* Learning and applying new technologies.

Disclaimer!  The aim of this project is for learning.  As a result, the UIs aren't shiny, there may be bugs and features may be incomplete.  However all the bugs found are fixed and the UIs are polished to the point of making them usable.
